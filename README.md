# Neuro-Evolution Review

## A Comprehensive Review of Neuro-Evolution Research
An interactive report on the history, current state, and future of biologically inspired AI.

### Our Methodology
This report is an interactive summary of key research papers. Our selection process prioritizes **impact and reproducibility**. We have focused on influential works with high citation counts and, crucially, publicly available code repositories on GitHub. Newer papers with low citations are included if they have been published in a respected venue or provide a public code repository, as this indicates strong potential for future impact.
